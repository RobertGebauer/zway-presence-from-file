This app can used if you are able to detect person presence and write a token into a file if the person is present, e.g. by using Bluetooth beacons.<br><br>Please see README.md or check <a href='https://github.com/RobertGebauer/zway-presence-from-file'>https://github.com/RobertGebauer/zway-presence-from-file</a> for further description and an example how to build such a setting.",
